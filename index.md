Here's where I put some of the projects I do as I learn java, html, css, javascript and more :)

<a href = "https://mikielmcrae.github.io/analog-clock">Analog clock using html, css, javascript</a>

<a href = "https://mikielmcrae.github.io/stopwatch/">Stopwatch with html, css, javascript</a>

More to come!
